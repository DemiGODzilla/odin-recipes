        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is another 1-bowl recipe! It also requires simple ingredients you likely have on hand right now.</p>
        <p>The base of the batter is flax eggs, applesauce, coconut oil, and almond milk. Good news! These muffins are naturally sweetened with maple syrup and coconut sugar.</p>
        <p>The chocolate flavor comes from cocoa powder and vegan dark chocolate chips (my favorites being Enjoy Life or Trader Joe’s). I suggest a modest amount of chocolate chips in the recipe, but then I went ahead and topped them with another hefty handful before baking. Because chocolate is life.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp flaxseed meal (to make flax eggs)</li>
            <li>5 Tbsp water (to make flax eggs)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup applesauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/3 cup coconut sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup melted coconut oil (or sub another neutral oil)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>3/4 cup gluten-free flour blend</li>
            <li>1/4 cup gluten-free oat flour (finely ground rolled oats)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup almond flour (or almond meal, though I haven’t tested it this way)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dairy-free semisweet chocolate chips (plus more for topping)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line 9-10 muffins (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) with paper liners (I prefer these, as they don’t stick to the muffins).</li>
            <li>Prepare flax eggs by mixing flaxseed meal and water in a large mixing bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add applesauce, maple syrup, coconut sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and sea salt and whisk again. Then stir in the melted coconut oil and almond milk and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add cocoa powder, gluten-free flour, oat flour, and almond flour and whisk until just combined. If the batter appears too thick, add a touch more almond milk. But it should be quite thick and NOT pourable – rather scoopable.</li>
            <li>Lastly, stir in chocolate chips. Then divide batter evenly between muffin tins, filling all the way full (should be enough for 9-10 // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), and top with a few more chocolate chips (optional).</li>
            <li>Bake for 22-28 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the edges appear dry. Let cool for 5 minutes in the pan. Then remove from tins and let cool on a cooling rack. Texture is best when cooled completely.</li>
            <li>Will keep covered at room temperature for 3-4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.</li>
        </ol>
